# Basic Function with Minimal Dependencies (Java)
This project includes function code and supporting resources:
- src/main - A Java function.
- src/test - A unit test and helper classes.
- template.yml - An AWS CloudFormation template that creates an application.
- build.gradle - A Gradle build file.
- pom.xml - A Maven build file.
- 1-create-bucket.sh, 2-deploy.sh, etc. - Shell scripts that use the AWS CLI to deploy and manage the application.

Use the following instructions to deploy the sample application.

# Requirements
- [Java 8 runtime environment (SE JRE)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Gradle 5](https://gradle.org/releases/) or [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html)
- The Bash shell. For Linux and macOS, this is included by default. In Windows 10, you can install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to get a Windows-integrated version of Ubuntu and Bash.
- [The AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

# Setup
Download or clone this repository.

    $ git clone git@github.com:awsdocs/aws-lambda-developer-guide.git
    $ cd aws-lambda-developer-guide/sample-apps/java-events

Run `1-create-bucket.sh` to create a new bucket for deployment artifacts. Or, if you already have a bucket, create a file named `bucket-name.txt` that contains the name of your bucket.

    java-events$ ./1-create-bucket.sh
    make_bucket: lambda-artifacts-a5e4xmplb5b22e0d

# Deploy
Run `2-deploy.sh` to build the application with Gradle and deploy it.

    java-events$ ./2-deploy.sh
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
    Successfully packaged artifacts and wrote output template to file out.yml.
    Waiting for changeset to be created..
    Successfully created/updated stack - java-events

This script uses AWS CloudFormation to deploy the Lambda functions and an IAM role. If the AWS CloudFormation stack that contains the resources already exists, the script updates it with any changes to the template or function code.

You can also build the application with Maven. To use maven, add `mvn` to the command.

    java-events$ ./2-deploy.sh mvn

# Test
Run `3-invoke.sh` to invoke the function.

    java-events$ ./3-invoke.sh
    {
        "StatusCode": 200,
        "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
    }
    {"isBase64Encoded":false,"statusCode":200,"headers":{"Content-Type":"text/html"},"body":"<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>AWS Lambda sample</title></head><body><h1>Welcome</h1><p>Page generated by a Lambda function.</p></body></html>"}

The functions in this application are instrumented with AWS X-Ray. Open the [X-Ray console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home#/service-map) to view the service map.

![Service Map](/sample-apps/java-events/images/java-events-servicemap.png)

Choose a node in the main function graph. Then choose **View traces** to see a list of traces. Choose any trace to view a timeline that breaks down the work done by the function.

Finally, view the application in the Lambda console.

*To view the output*
1. Open the [applications page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/applications) in the Lambda console.
2. Choose **java-events**.

# Configure Handler Class

By default, the function uses a handler class named `Handler` that takes a map as input and returns a string. The project also includes handlers that use other input and output types. These are defined in the following files under src/main/java/example:

- `Handler.java` – Takes `APIGatewayV2ProxyRequestEvent` as input and returns `APIGatewayV2ProxyResponseEvent`.
- `HandlerApiG.java` – Takes `APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent` as input and returns `APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent`.

To use a different handler, change the value of the Handler setting in the application template (`template.yml` or `template-mvn.yaml`). For example, to use the API Gateway v1 handler:

    Properties:
      CodeUri: build/distributions/java-events.zip
      Handler: example.HandlerApiG

Deploy the change, and then use the invoke script to test the new configuration. For handlers, that don't take a JSON object as input, pass the type (e.g. `apig`) as an argument to the invoke script.

    ./3-invoke.sh apig
    {
        "StatusCode": 200,
        "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
    }

# Cleanup
To delete the application, run `4-cleanup.sh`.

    java-events$ ./4-cleanup.sh
